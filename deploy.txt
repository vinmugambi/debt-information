The requirements for the application to run are nodejs and postgres database. Since DevTest-002.pdf indicates
that there is already a postgres database already in place, I'm only going to cover installation of nodejs on
a debian/ubuntu linux distributions which will be responsible for running server side javascript.

Other tools needed are curl and git which come bundled together with majority of popular linux distributions.

INSTALLATION OF NODEJS

Copy the following commands on your terminal to install nodejs and npm.

```
curl -sL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_6.x | sudo -E bash -
sudo apt-get install -y nodejs
```

After the libraries are downloaded run the following commands to confirm nodejs and its package manager (npm) were
correctly installed

```
node -v
npm -v
```

RUNNING THE APPLICATION

Clone the repository at https://github.com/vinmugambi/debt-information and navigate to the projects root folder by
running the following commands.

```
git clone https://github.com/vinmugambi/debt-information.git
cd debt-information
```

Then run the following command to install the application dependencies.

```
npm install
```

NOTE: Incase you are using a different database other than the one specified in DevTest-002.pdf then you should edit
      app/config/sequelize.js to conform to your database as directed in the comments preceeding the code. ie

      ```js
      app/config/sequelize.js

      const sequelize = new Sequelize('postgres://db_username:db_password@db_host:db_port/db_name')
      ```


You should then run the setup.js file found on the project's  top level directory as follows

```
node setup.js
```
The above command will overwrite any tables with any of this names: tbl_users,tbl_profiles,tbl_due_listing and
replace them with new ones with same names.
It also enters dummy data into  all the tables it creates. The passwords in tbl_users are hashed using bcrypt.

Finally run the application by typing the following on the terminal

```
npm start
```
You should see "Application is listening on port 3000" on the console.
